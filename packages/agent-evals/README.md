# @apo/agent-evals

Adversarial eval harness for `@apo/agent-orchestrator`: it drives the orchestrator in-process with hostile scenarios and checks safety invariants and metrics. What it deliberately does not do is described in the spec, §1 "what it does NOT do". Today this package is only a scaffold with a smoke test proving the orchestrator resolves as a workspace library.

## Running

The system under test is consumed from its built `dist` via its `exports` map, so it must be built first: run `pnpm run build` at the repo root. `pnpm --filter @apo/agent-evals test` does this for you via its `pretest` script, which guards against a stale `dist` producing a silent false green.
